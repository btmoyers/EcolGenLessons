## Writing for loops

Loops are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute commands repeatedly. 
Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the amount of typing (and typing mistakes). 
Loops are helpful when performing operations on groups of sequencing files, such as unzipping or trimming multiple
files. We will use loops for these purposes in subsequent analyses, but will cover the basics of them for now.

When the shell sees the keyword `for`, it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list. 
Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to the **variable**, and 
the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to the next item in the list. Inside the loop, we call for 
the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it. The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat the **variable**
as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or an external command. In shell programming, this is usually called "expanding" the variable.

Sometimes, we want to expand a variable without any whitespace to its right.
Suppose we have a variable named `foo` that contains the text `abc`, and would
like to expand `foo` to create the text `abcEFG`.

~~~
$ foo=abc
$ echo foo is $foo
foo is abc
$ echo foo is $fooEFG      # doesn't work
foo is
~~~
{: .bash}

The interpreter is trying to expand a variable named `fooEFG`, which (probably)
doesn't exist. We can avoid this problem by enclosing the variable name in 
braces (`{` and `}`, sometimes called "squiggle braces").

~~~
$ foo=abc
$ echo foo is $foo
foo is abc
$ echo foo is ${foo}EFG      # now it works!
foo is abcEFG
~~~
{: .bash}

Let's write a for loop to show us the first two lines of the fastq files we downloaded earlier. You will notice the shell prompt changes from `$` to `>` and back again as we were typing in our loop. The second prompt, `>`, is different to remind us that we haven’t finished typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, `;`, can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.

~~~
$ cd ../untrimmed_fastq/
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> head -n 2 ${filename}
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

The for loop begins with the formula `for <variable> in <group to iterate over>`. In this case, the word `filename` is designated 
as the variable to be used over each iteration. In our case `SRR097977.fastq` and `SRR098026.fastq` will be substituted for `filename` 
because they fit the pattern of ending with .fastq in the directory we've specified. The next line of the for loop is `do`. The next line is 
the code that we want to execute. We are telling the loop to print the first two lines of each variable we iterate over. Finally, the
word `done` ends the loop.

After executing the loop, you should see the first two lines of both fastq files printed to the terminal. Let's create a loop that 
will save this information to a file.

~~~
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> head -n 2 ${filename} >> seq_info.txt
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

Note that we are using `>>` to append the text to our `seq_info.txt` file. If we used `>`, the `seq_info.txt` file would be rewritten
every time the loop iterates, so it would only have text from the last variable used. Instead, `>>` adds to the end of the file.

## Using Basename in for loops
Basename is a function in UNIX that is helpful for removing a uniform part of a name from a list of files. In this case, we will use basename to remove the `.fastq` extension from the files that we’ve been working with. 

~~~
$ basename SRR097977.fastq .fastq
~~~
{: .bash}

We see that this returns just the SRR accession, and no longer has the .fastq file extension on it.

~~~
SRR097977
~~~
{: .output}

If we try the same thing but use `.fasta` as the file extension instead, nothing happens. This is because basename only works when it exactly matches a string in the file.

~~~
$ basename SRR097977.fastq .fasta
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
SRR097977.fastq
~~~
{: .output}

Basename is really powerful when used in a for loop. It allows to access just the file prefix, which you can use to name things. Let's try this.

Inside our for loop, we create a new name variable. We call the basename function inside the parenthesis, then give our variable name from the for loop, in this case `${filename}`, and finally state that `.fastq` should be removed from the file name. It’s important to note that we’re not changing the actual files, we’re creating a new variable called name. The line > echo $name will print to the terminal the variable name each time the for loop runs. Because we are iterating over two files, we expect to see two lines of output.

~~~
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> name=$(basename ${filename} .fastq)
> echo ${name}
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

One way this is really useful is to move files. Let's rename all of our .txt files using `mv` so that they have the years on them, which will document when we created them. 

~~~
$ for filename in *.txt
> do
> name=$(basename ${filename} .txt)
> mv ${filename}  ${name}_2019.txt
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

## File manipulation and more practice with pipes

Let's use the tools we've added to our tool kit so far, along with a few new ones, to example our SRA metadata file. First, let's navigate to the correct directory.

~~~
$ cd
$ cd shell_data/sra_metadata
~~~
{: .bash}

This file contains a lot of information about the samples that we submitted for sequencing. We
took a look at this file in an earlier lesson. Here we're going to use the information in this
file to answer some questions about our samples.

#### How many of the read libraries are paired end?

The samples that we submitted to the sequencing facility were a mix of single and paired end
libraries. We know that we recorded information in our metadata table about which samples used 
which library preparation method, but we don't remember exactly where this data is recorded. 
Let's start by looking at our column headers to see which column might have this information. Our
column headers are in the first row of our data table, so we can use `head` with a `-n` flag to
look at just the first row of the file.

~~~
$ head -n 1 SraRunTable.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
BioSample_s	InsertSize_l	LibraryLayout_s	Library_Name_s	LoadDate_s	MBases_l	MBytes_l	ReleaseDate_s Run_s SRA_Sample_s Sample_Name_s Assay_Type_s AssemblyName_s BioProject_s Center_Name_s Consent_s Organism_Platform_s SRA_Study_s g1k_analysis_group_s g1k_pop_code_s source_s strain_s
~~~
{: .output}

That is only the first line of our file, but because there are a lot of columns, the output
likely wraps around your terminal window and appears as multiple lines. Once we figure out which
column our data is in, we can use a command called `cut` to extract the column of interest.

Because this is pretty hard to read, we can look at just a few column header names at a time by combining the `|` redirect and `cut`.

~~~
$ head -n 1 SraRunTable.txt | cut -f1-4
~~~
{: .bash}

`cut` takes a `-f` flag, which stands for "field". This flag accepts a list of field numbers,
in our case, column numbers. Here we are extracting the first four column names.

~~~
BioSample_s InsertSize_l      LibraryLayout_s	Library_Name_s    
~~~
{: .output}

The LibraryLayout_s column looks like it should have the information we want.  Let's look at some
of the data from that column. We can use `cut` to extract only the 3rd column from the file and
then use the `|` operator with `head` to look at just the first few lines of data in that column.

~~~
$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | head -n 10
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
LibraryLayout_s
SINGLE
SINGLE
SINGLE
SINGLE
SINGLE
SINGLE
SINGLE
SINGLE
PAIRED
~~~
{: .output}

We can see that there are (at least) two categories, SINGLE and PAIRED.  We want to search all entries in this column
for just PAIRED and count the number of matches. For this, we will use the `|` operator twice
to combine `cut` (to extract the column we want), `grep` (to find matches) and `wc` (to count matches).

~~~
$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | grep PAIRED | wc -l
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
2
~~~
{: .output}

We can see from this that we have only two paired-end libraries in the samples we submitted for 
sequencing.

{: .challenge}

#### How many of each class of library layout are there?  

We can extract even more information from our metadata table if we add in some new tools: `sort` and `uniq`. The `sort` command will sort the lines of a text file and the `uniq` command will
filter out repeated neighboring lines in a file. You might expect `uniq` to
extract all of the unique lines in a file. This isn't what it does, however, for reasons
involving computer memory and speed. If we want to extract all unique lines, we 
can do so by combining `uniq` with `sort`. We'll see how to do this soon.

For example, if we want to know how many samples of each library type are recorded in our table,
we can extract the third column (with `cut`), and pipe that output into `sort`. 

~~~
$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | sort
~~~
{: .bash}

If you look closely, you might see that we have one line that reads "LibraryLayout_s". This is the 
header of our column. We can discard this information using the `-v` flag in `grep`, which means 
return all the lines that **do not** match the search pattern.

~~~
$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | grep -v LibraryLayout_s | sort
~~~
{: .bash}

This command returns a sorted list (too long to show here) of PAIRED and SINGLE values. We can use
the `uniq` command to see a list of all the different categories that are present. If we do this,
we see that the only two types of libraries we have present are labelled PAIRED and SINGLE. There 
aren't any other types in our file.

~~~
$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | grep -v LibraryLayout_s | sort | uniq
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
PAIRED
SINGLE
~~~
{: .output}

If we want to count how many of each we have, we can use the `-c` (count) flag for `uniq`. 

~~~
$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | grep -v LibraryLayout_s | sort | uniq -c
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
2 PAIRED
35 SINGLE
~~~
{: .output}

#### Can we sort the file by library layout and save that sorted information to a new file?  

We might want to re-order our entire metadata table so that all of the paired-end samples appear
together and all of the single-end samples appear together. We can use the `-k` (key) flag for `sort` to
sort based on a particular column. This is similar to the `-f` flag for `cut`.

Let's sort based on the third column (`-k3`) and redirect our output to a new file.

~~~
$ sort -k3 SraRunTable.txt > SraRunTable_sorted_by_layout.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

#### Can we extract only paired-end records into a new file?  

We also might want to extract the information for all samples that meet a specific criterion 
(for example, are paired-end) and put those lines of our table in a new file. First, we need
to check to make sure that the pattern we're searching for ("PAIRED") only appears in the column
where we expect it to occur (column 3). We know from earlier that there are only two paired-end
samples in the file, so we can `grep` for "PAIRED" and see how many results we get.

~~~
$ grep PAIRED SraRunTable.txt | wc -l
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
2
~~~
{: .output}

There are only two results, so we can use "PAIRED" as our search term to extract the paired-end 
samples to a new file.

~~~
$ grep PAIRED SraRunTable.txt > SraRunTable_only_paired_end.txt
~~~
{: .bash}
