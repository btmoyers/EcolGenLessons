## What is a shell and why should I care?

A *shell* is a computer program that presents a command line interface
which allows you to control your computer using commands entered
with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

There are many reasons to learn about the shell:

* Many bioinformatics tools can only be used through a command line interface, or 
have extra capabilities in the command line version that are not available in the GUI.
This is true, for example, of BLAST, which offers many advanced functions only accessible
to users who know how to use a shell.  
* The shell makes your work less boring. In bioinformatics you often need to do
the same set of tasks with a large number of files. Learning the shell will allow you to
automate those repetitive tasks and leave you free to do more exciting things.  
* The shell makes your work less error-prone. When humans do the same thing a hundred different times
(or even ten times), they're likely to make a mistake. Your computer can do the same thing a thousand times
with no mistakes.  
* The shell makes your work more reproducible. When you carry out your work in the command-line 
(rather than a GUI), your computer keeps a record of every step that you've carried out, which you can use 
to re-do your work when you need to. It also gives you a way to communicate unambiguously what you've done, 
so that others can check your work or apply your process to new data.  
* Many bioinformatic tasks require large amounts of computing power and can't realistically be run on your
own machine. These tasks are best performed using remote computers or cloud computing, which can only be accessed
through a shell.

In this lesson you will learn how to use the command line interface to move around in your file system. 

## How to access the shell

On a Mac or Linux machine, you can access a shell through a program called Terminal, which is already available
on your computer. If you're using Windows, you'll need to download a separate program to access the shell. We will spend most of our time learning about the basics of the shell
by manipulating some experimental data. 

The Shell is a program which runs other programs rather than doing calculations itself.
Those programs can be as complicated as climate modeling software and as simple as a
program that creates a new directory. The simple programs which are used to perform
stand alone tasks are usually refered to as commands.
The most popular Unix shell is Bash, (the Bourne Again SHell --- so-called because
it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).
Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix
and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

~~~
$
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The shell typically uses `$ ` as the prompt, but may use a different symbol.
In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as `$ `.
Most importantly:
when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
*do not type the prompt*, only the commands that follow it.

So let's try our first command, which will list the contents of the current directory:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Command not found
> If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it
> will print an error message such as:
>
> ~~~
> $ ks
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
> ~~~
> ks: command not found
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> Usually this means that you have mis-typed the command.
{: .callout}


## Navigating your file system

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
is called the **file system**.
It organizes our data into files,
which hold information,
and directories (also called "folders"),
which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.

Let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for "print working directory").
At any moment, our **current working directory**
is our current default directory,
i.e.,
the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in,
unless we explicitly specify something else.
Here,
the computer's response will be specific to your operating system, file system, and user name:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
/Users/malusmalls
~~~
{: .output}

Let's look at how our file system is organized. We can see what files and subdirectories are in this directory by running `ls`,
which stands for "listing":

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Applications		Downloads		Pictures
Creative Cloud Files	Library			Public
Desktop			Movies
Documents		Music
~~~
{: .output}

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in
alphabetical order,
arranged neatly into columns. 
We'll be working within the `shell_data` subdirectory, and creating new subdirectories, throughout this workshop.  

The command to change locations in our file system is `cd`, followed by a
directory name to change our working directory.
`cd` stands for "change directory".

Let's say we want to navigate to the `shell_data` directory we saw above.  I can
use the following command to get there:

~~~
$ cd Desktop/shell_data
~~~
{: .bash}

You might need to use a different set of "directions", depending, again, on your file system. Once you've navigated to `shell_data`, let's look at what is in this directory:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
sra_metadata  untrimmed_fastq
~~~
{: .output}

We can make the `ls` output more comprehensible by using the **flag** `-F`,
which tells `ls` to add a trailing `/` to the names of directories:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
sra_metadata/  untrimmed_fastq/
~~~
{: .output}

Anything with a "/" after it is a directory. Things with a "*" after them are programs. If
there are no decorations, it's a file.

`ls` has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:

~~~
$ man ls
~~~
{: .bash}

If you are working on a Windows OS and get an error message that `man` is not a command known to your bash shell, try:

~~~
$ ls --help
~~~
{: .bash}

Some manual files are very long. You can scroll through the file using
your keyboard's down arrow or use the <kbd>Space</kbd> key to go forward one page
and the <kbd>b</kbd> key to go backwards one page. When you are done reading, hit <kbd>q</kbd>
to quit.

> ## Challenge

{: .challenge}

No one can possibly learn all of these arguments, that's what the manual page
is for. You can (and should) refer to the manual page or other help files
as needed.

Let's go into the `untrimmed_fastq` directory and see what is in there.

~~~
$ cd untrimmed_fastq
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
SRR097977.fastq  SRR098026.fastq
~~~
{: .output}

This directory contains two files with `.fastq` extensions. FASTQ is a format
for storing information about sequencing reads and their quality.

### Shortcut: Tab Completion

Typing out file or directory names can waste a
lot of time and it's easy to make typing mistakes. Instead we can use tab complete 
as a shortcut. When you start typing out the name of a directory or file, then
hit the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, the shell will try to fill in the rest of the
directory or file name.

Return to your home directory:

~~~
$ cd
~~~
{: .bash}

then enter:

~~~
$ cd she<tab>
~~~
{: .bash}

The shell will fill in the rest of the directory name for
`shell_data`.

Now change directories to `untrimmed_fastq` in `shell_data`

~~~
$ cd shell_data
$ cd untrimmed_fastq
~~~
{: .bash}

Using tab complete can be very helpful. However, it will only autocomplete
a file or directory name if you've typed enough characters to provide
a unique identifier for the file or directory you are trying to access.

If we navigate back to our `untrimmed_fastq` directory and try to access one
of our sample files:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd shell_data
$ cd untrimmed_fastq
$ ls SR<tab>
~~~
{: .bash}

The shell auto-completes your command to `SRR09`, because all file names in 
the directory begin with this prefix. When you hit
<kbd>Tab</kbd> again, the shell will list the possible choices.

~~~
$ ls SRR09<tab><tab>
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
SRR097977.fastq  SRR098026.fastq
~~~
{: .output}

Tab completion can also fill in the names of programs, which can be useful if you
remember the beginning of a program name.

~~~
$ pw<tab><tab>
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
pwd         pwd_mkdb    pwhich      pwhich5.16  pwhich5.18  pwpolicy
~~~
{: .output}

Displays the name of every program that starts with `pw`. 

## Summary

We now know how to move around our file system using the command line.
This gives us an advantage over interacting with the file system through
a GUI as it allows us to work on a remote server, carry out the same set of operations 
on a large number of files quickly, and opens up many opportunities for using 
bioinformatic software that is only available in command line versions. 

In the next few episodes, we'll be expanding on these skills and seeing how 
using the command line shell enables us to make our workflow more efficient and reproducible.
