## Writing files

We've been able to do a lot of work with files that already exist, but what if we want to write our own files? We're not going to type in a FASTA file, but we'll see as we go through other tutorials, there are a lot of reasons we'll want to write a file, or edit an existing file.

To add text to files, we're going to use a text editor called Nano. We're going to create a file to take notes about what we've been doing with the data files in `~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq`.

This is good practice when working in bioinformatics. We can create a file called `README.txt` that describes the data files in the directory or documents how the files in that directory were generated.  As the name suggests, it's a file that we or others should read to understand the information in that directory.

Let's change our working directory to `~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq` using `cd`,
then run `nano` to create a file called `README.txt`:

~~~
$ cd ~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq
$ nano README.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

You should see something like this: 

![nano201711.png](../img/nano201711.png)

The text at the bottom of the screen shows the keyboard shortcuts for performing various tasks in `nano`. We will talk more about how to interpret this information soon.

> ## Which Editor?
>
> When we say, "`nano` is a text editor," we really do mean "text": it can
> only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other
> human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the 
> least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may 
> not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do
> after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X),
> many programmers use [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or
> [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (both of which require more time to learn), 
> or a graphical editor such as
> [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/). On Windows, you may wish to
> use [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).  Windows also has a built-in
> editor called `notepad` that can be run from the command line in the same
> way as `nano` for the purposes of this lesson.

> No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches

> your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or
> documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to
> another directory the first time you "Save As..."
{: .callout}

Let's type in a few lines of text. Describe what the files in this
directory are or what you've been doing with them.
Once we're happy with our text, we can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>O</kbd> (press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while
holding it down, press the <kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk. You'll be asked what file we want to save this to:
press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the suggested default of `README.txt`.

Once our file is saved, we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>X</kbd> to quit the editor and
return to the shell.

> ## Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key
>
> The Control key is also called the "Ctrl" key. There are various ways
> in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may
> see an instruction to press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key and, while holding it down,
> press the <kbd>X</kbd> key, described as any of:
>
> * `Control-X`
> * `Control+X`
> * `Ctrl-X`
> * `Ctrl+X`
> * `^X`
> * `C-x`
>
> In `nano`, along the bottom of the screen you'll see `^G Get Help ^O WriteOut`.
> This means that you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>G</kbd> to get help and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>O</kbd> to save your
> file.
{: .callout}

Now you've written a file. You can take a look at it with `less` or `cat`, or open it up again and edit it with `nano`.

> ## Exercise
>
> Open `README.txt` and add the date to the top of the file and save the file. 
>
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > Use `nano README.txt` to open the file.  
> > Add today's date and then use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>X</kbd> followed by `y` and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save.

## Writing scripts

A really powerful thing about the command line is that you can write scripts. Scripts let you save commands to run them and also lets you put multiple commands together. Though writing scripts may require an additional time investment initially, this can save you time as you run them repeatedly. Scripts can also address the challenge of reproducibility: if you need to repeat an analysis, you retain a record of your command history within the script.

One thing we will commonly want to do with sequencing results is pull out bad reads and write them to a file to see if we can figure out what's going on with them. We're going to look for reads with long sequences of N's like we did before, but now we're going to write a script, so we can run it each time we get new sequences, rather than type the code in by hand each time.

We're going to create a new file to put this command in. We'll call it `bad-reads-script.sh`. The `sh` isn't required, but using that extension tells us that it's a shell script.

~~~
$ nano bad-reads-script.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

Bad reads have a lot of N's, so we're going to look for  `NNNNNNNNNN` with `grep`. We want the whole FASTQ record, so we're also going to get the one line above the sequence and the two lines below. We also want to look in all the files that end with `.fastq`, so we're going to use the `*` wildcard.

~~~
grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN *.fastq > scripted_bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

Type your `grep` command into the file and save it as before. Be careful that you did not add the `$` at the beginning of the line.

Now comes the neat part. We can run this script. Type:

~~~
$ bash bad-reads-script.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

It will look like nothing happened, but now if you look at `scripted_bad_reads.txt`, you can see that there are now reads in the file.


> ## Exercise
>
> We want the script to tell us when it's done.  
> 1. Open `bad-reads-script.sh` and add the line `echo "Script finished!"` after the `grep` command and save the file.  
> 2. Run the updated script.

> >    ```
> >   $ bash bad-reads-script.sh
> >   Script finished!
> >   ```
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Making the script into a program

We had to type `bash` because we needed to tell the computer what program to use to run this script. Instead, we can turn this script into its own program. We need to tell it that it's a program by making it executable. We can do this by changing the file permissions. We talked about permissions in [an earlier episode](http://www.datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/03-working-with-files/).

First, let's look at the current permissions.

~~~
$ ls -l bad-reads-script.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dcuser dcuser 0 Oct 25 21:46 bad-reads-script.sh
~~~
{: .output}

We see that it says `-rw-r--r--`. This shows that the file can be read by any user and written to by the file owner (you). We want to change these permissions so that the file can be executed as a program. We use the command `chmod` like we did earlier when we removed write permissions. Here we are adding (`+`) executable permissions (`+x`).

~~~
$ chmod +x bad-reads-script.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

Now let's look at the permissions again.

~~~
$ ls -l bad-reads-script.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
-rwxrwxr-x 1 dcuser dcuser 0 Oct 25 21:46 bad-reads-script.sh
~~~
{: .output}

Now we see that it says `-rwxr-xr-x`. The `x`'s that are there now tell us we can run it as a program. So, let's try it! We'll need to put `./` at the beginning so the computer knows to look here in this directory for the program.

~~~
$ ./bad-reads-script.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

The script should run the same way as before, but now we've created our very own computer program!

You can learn more about writing scripts in an [optional lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/wrangling-genomics/05-automation/index.html).

# Bioinformatic workflows

When working with high-throughput sequencing data, the raw reads you get off of the sequencer will need to pass
through a number of  different tools in order to generate your final desired output. The execution of this set of
tools in a specified order is commonly referred to as a *workflow* or a *pipeline*. 

An example of the workflow that one could use is provided below with a brief description of each step. 

![workflow](../img/variant_calling_workflow.png)


1. Quality control - Assessing quality using FastQC
2. Quality control - Trimming and/or filtering reads (if necessary)
3. Align reads to reference genome 
4. Perform post-alignment clean-up
5. Variant calling

These workflows in bioinformatics adopt a plug-and-play approach in that the output of one tool can be easily
used as input to another tool without any extensive configuration. Having standards for data formats is what 
makes this feasible. Standards ensure that data is stored in a way that is generally accepted and agreed upon 
within the community. The tools that are used to analyze data at different stages of the workflow are therefore 
built under the assumption that the data will be provided in a specific format.  

Often times, the first step in a bioinformatic workflow is getting the data you want to work with onto a computer where you can work with it. If you have outsourced sequencing of your data, the sequencing center will usually provide you with a link that you can use to download your data. You will also download archived data for your reproductive analyses.

## Moving and Downloading Data

So far, we've worked with data we either had stored on our own computers or moved between our 
computers and the cluster. Usually, however, most analyses begin with moving data onto the 
server or cloud instance. In the case of your reproduced papers, these data will often be on the web. 
Below we'll show you some commands to download data onto a server or cloud instance.

### Getting data from the cloud

There are two programs that will download data from a remote server to your local
(or remote) machine: ``wget`` and ``curl``. They were designed to do slightly different
tasks by default, so you'll need to give the programs somewhat different options to get
the same behaviour, but they are mostly interchangeable.

 - ``wget`` is short for "world wide web get", and it's basic function is to *download*
 web pages or data at a web address.

 - ``cURL`` is a pun, it is supposed to be read as "see URL", so its basic function is
 to *display* webpages or data at a web address.

Which one you need to use mostly depends on your operating system, as most computers will
only have one or the other installed by default.

Let's say you want to download some data from Ensembl. We're going to download a very small
tab-delimited file that just tells us what data is available on the Ensembl bacteria server.
Before we can start our download, we need to know whether we're using ``curl`` or ``wget``.

To see which program you have, type:
 
~~~
$ which curl
$ which wget
~~~
{: .bash}

``which`` is a BASH program that looks through everything you have
installed, and tells you what folder it is installed to. If it can't
find the program you asked for, it returns nothing, i.e. gives you no
results.

On Mac OSX, you'll likely get the following output:

~~~
$ which curl
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
/usr/bin/curl
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ which wget
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
$
~~~
{: .output}

This output means that you have ``curl`` installed, but not ``wget``.

Once you know whether you have ``curl`` or ``wget``, use one of the
following commands to download the file:

~~~
$ cd
$ wget ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/release-37/bacteria/species_EnsemblBacteria.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

or

~~~
$ cd
$ curl -O ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/release-37/bacteria/species_EnsemblBacteria.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

Since we wanted to *download* the file rather than just view it, we used ``wget`` without
any modifiers. With ``curl`` however, we had to use the -O flag, which simultaneously tells ``curl`` to
download the page instead of showing it to us **and** specifies that it should save the
file using the same name it had on the server: species_EnsemblBacteria.txt

It's important to note that both ``curl`` and ``wget`` download to the computer that the
command line belongs to. So, if you are logged into AWS on the command line and execute
the ``curl`` command above in the AWS terminal, the file will be downloaded to your AWS
machine, not your local one.
